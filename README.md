# raspi-lockout
Access Control on a Raspberry Pi
================================

This purpose of this project is to provide a very user-friendly and comparatively low cost machine access control system. Especially in places like machine shops on university campuses, these electronic lockout controllers make it very easy to ensure users are trained prior to using equipment, and keeping track of who uses what and when is made trivial.

Hardware
--------
Typical hardware implementation of a Raspberry Pi running this script, connected to an LCD, relay board, and USB magstripe reader. A big emergency stop mushroom switch with two contact blocks allows for both hard and soft emergency stop circuit control. All of these components are then placed in a sealed project box, making it suitable for use in dusty or wet environments, such as a machine shop.
